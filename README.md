## Introduction

The Learning Project: Blogging Platform is a hands-on exercise to deepen your understanding of building web applications with Node.js and implementing Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Throughout this project, you'll create a simple blogging platform that includes user authentication, blog &  commenting system.

## Installation

To run the blogging platform locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ankitdas13/node-blog-ssr.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the necessary configuration (e.g., database credentials, authentication secrets).
5. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Usage

Explain how users can use the application, including how to create an account, write a blog post, manage posts, etc.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js (or any other web framework you are using)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- MongoDB (or any other database you are using)
